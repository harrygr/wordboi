# WordBoi

This is a clone of [Wordle][wordle] built using Next.js/React, mostly for my own practice/education.

The main difference is that it uses 6-letter words instead of 5.

You can try it out at [https://wordboi.vercel.app][wordboi].

## Getting Started

Check out the repo, install the deps, run `yarn dev` (or `yarn build && yarn start`)
